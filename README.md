## Project Summary

- Predict the claims over the next year for a motor insurance client using personal and vehicle information.
- Use state-of-the-art techniques that combine deep learning with traditional statistical methods to facilitate accurate predictions of all-inclusive claim costs whilst providing the capability to intuitively interrogate and explain the model’s prediction. Here is a research paper covering the proposed techniques →  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11059.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11059.pdf)
Why it is important: In insurance, claim estimation is an integral part of the pricing and reserving pipeline. Being able to generate a fully transparent and highly accurate prediction for a given risk is indispensable for all insurers as it: 1) enables insurers to accurately price for various risk levels, 2) facilitates regulatory reporting, and 3) informs business strategy on how various market segments should be treated. Traditional approaches such as GLM’s are fully transparent but lack in terms of accuracy and also require significant manual feature selection and interactions set-up. Deep learning however handles feature selection implicitly and is generally more accurate than traditional approaches but lacks transparency. Recent advances saw the unification of these two approaches and hence the road is already paved to implement these methods and possibly create a stand-alone SaaS product leveraging these SOTA methods.
- The project output: A model that predicts the all-inclusive claim cost for a given unit of exposure with high accuracy whilst providing full transparency in the model’s decisions.

- We have quite a few insurance clients in ExploreAI, so it’s incredibly important that we invest in R&D to make sure our models are as good as they can be.
- Utilising these SOTA methods and essentially getting ahead of the curve will be a key differentiator for ExploreAI in the pricing space and extending the outcomes from this R&D project to a SaaS solution is a realistic possibility.
